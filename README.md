## Introduction

### Why a Local Grocery Deals Newsletter?

Food prices in Newfoundland and Labrador have risen sharply in recent years, and many residents rely on weekly flyers and loyalty points to make ends meet. A curated newsletter that highlights the best grocery deals across the province can save subscribers money and create a loyal following.

A strong audience also opens opportunities to generate revenue through:
- **Advertising**
- **Affiliate links**
- **Premium memberships**

Below is a step-by-step guide to launch, design, and monetize a daily deals newsletter.

---

## 1. Research & Planning

### 1.1 Define Your Audience

- **Focus initially** on St. John's and major population centres (Mount Pearl, CBS, Corner Brook), then expand to rural areas
- **Consider segmenting lists by region** so that deals are relevant
- **Evaluate your total addressable market:** local newsletters are naturally capped by the province's population; adjust growth goals accordingly

### 1.2 Study Competitors

Subscribe to flyers and newsletters from:

| Major Chains | Discount Stores | Specialty |
|-------------|-----------------|-----------|
| Dominion | No Frills | Costco |
| Sobeys | Walmart | Specialty stores |
| Colemans | | |
| Foodland | | |

**Digital flyer apps to monitor:**
- Flipp
- Reebee
- Flyers Online

**Note:** Track the types of deals they highlight and any loyalty programs (PC Optimum, Scene+).

### 1.3 Aggregate Deals Daily

Because each chain releases flyers on different days, build a tracking spreadsheet (or a simple database) to log:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Sale Item | Product name |
| Sale Date | Start and end dates |
| Regular Price | Normal price |
| Sale Price | Discounted price |
| Category | Produce, meat, pantry, etc. |
| Store | Retailer name |
| Location | Store location |
| Loyalty Bonus | Point multipliers or bonuses |

**Tips:**
- Use RSS feeds or manual checks of store sites and Flipp to capture new deals quickly

### 1.4 Collect Local News

Readers appreciate context, such as store openings, expansions, and policy changes.

**Recent Industry News (2025):**

> **Loblaw** (owner of Dominion/No Frills) announced in February 2025 that it will invest **CA$2.2 billion** to build 80 new stores, remodel 300+ locations, and open a distribution centre.

> **Empire Co.** (owner of Sobeys and Foodland) plans to invest **CA$700 million** in fiscal 2025 and renovate 20–25% of its network while expanding Farm Boy, Longo's, and FreshCo.

Including such updates keeps the newsletter interesting and positions you as an authority.

## 2. Content & Design Best Practices

### 2.1 Set Expectations

Near the sign-up form, clearly state:
- **What** subscribers will receive
- **How often** it arrives

**Example:**
> *"Daily email featuring today's best grocery deals in Newfoundland & Labrador, plus tips and loyalty-point highlights."*

This transparency reduces spam reports and improves sign-up rates.

### 2.2 Provide Value First

A newsletter should be:
- **At least 90% informational**
- **Only ~10% promotional**

**Focus on:**
- Best deals
- Price comparisons
- Loyalty-point multipliers
- Shopping tips
- Occasional recipes or meal-planning suggestions using sale items

### 2.3 Organize Sections

Break the email into skimmable sections:

#### 📌 Top Deals Today
Highlight the three or four most significant savings across major chains.

#### 🗺️ Regional Highlights
Show deals specific to:
- Avalon Peninsula
- Central Region
- Western Region
- Labrador

#### 💳 Loyalty Point Bonuses
Note PC Optimum, Scene+, or Costco offers.

> **Example:** 1,000 Scene+ points ≈ $10 off groceries at Sobeys/Foodland

Feature a farmers' market or specialty store.

> **Example:** St. John's Farmers' Market — Saturdays 9 a.m.–4 p.m. at 245 Freshwater Rd

#### 💡 Quick Tips
Provide couponing strategies or ways to earn extra points.

### 2.4 Keep It Concise & Readable

- Use **clear headings** and **bullet points**
- Include **one primary call-to-action (CTA)** per email to avoid distraction

**Good CTA Examples:**
- "Share this newsletter"

### 2.5 Use Images Wisely

- Keep subject lines **under ~35 characters**

### 2.8 Segment Your Audience

Group subscribers by:
- **Location** (St. John's, Corner Brook, Labrador, etc.)
- **Interest** (budget shoppers, organic seekers, coupon enthusiasts)

Send targeted deals and use surveys to adjust content based on preferences.

### 2.9 Schedule & Test

- Plan a **content calendar** (daily or weekly)
- Use **A/B testing** to refine:
  - Subject lines
